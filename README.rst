LXC in a nutshell
=================


This small book will guide you into setting up a server with several Linux
Containers (or LXC).

This book targets Ubuntu 14.04 with LXC 1.0, it should also be compatible with
other Linux distributions but for the most straighforward setup, I strongly
recommend using Ubuntu Server.


NOTE: While I still want to cover LXC in and out, I want to make the
subject broader and will cover lots of use cases of a server. LXC will be
used in each of these use case. 
I have yet to chose a title for this book.
