LXC in a nutshell
=================


This small book will guide you into setting up a server with several Linux 
Containers (or LXC). 

This book targets Ubuntu 13.10, LXC is also compatible with Debian or other 
Linux distributions but for the most straighforward setup, I strongly recommend
using Ubuntu Server.
