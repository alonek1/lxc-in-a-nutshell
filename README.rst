LXC in a nutshell
=================

Written by Mathieu Comandon.

This small book will guide you into setting up a server with several Linux
Containers (or LXC).

This book targets Ubuntu 14.04 with LXC 1.0, it should also be compatible
with other Linux distributions but for the most straightforward setup, I
strongly recommend using Ubuntu Server.


NOTE: While I still want to cover LXC in and out, I want to make the
subject broader and will cover lots of use cases of a server. LXC will be
used in each of these use case.
I have yet to chose a title for this book.
