LXC in a nutshell
=================


This small book will guide you into setting up a server with several Linux
Containers (or LXC).

This book targets Ubuntu 14.04 with LXC 1.0, it should also be compatible with
other Linux distributions but for the most straighforward setup, I strongly
recommend using Ubuntu Server.
